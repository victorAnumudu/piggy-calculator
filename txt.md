An interest calculator as the name sounds is a way of calculating the interest earn over a period of time on a certain amount if money.
 
Understanding Interest 

Two main types of interest can be applied to loans: simple and compound. Simple interest is a set rate on the principle originally lent to the borrower that the borrower has to pay for the ability to use the money. Compound interest is interest on both the principle and the compounding interest paid on that loan. The latter of the two types of interest is the most common.


Some of the considerations that go into calculating the type of interest are:

    Amount of expected inflation
    Length of time that the money is being lent
    Possibility of government intervention on interest rates
    Liquidity of the loan being made


This Interest calculator enables a user to know the interest that will be gained over a period of time as well as the total amount of money the user owns when the interest is included.


The formula I used is:

Interest=Principal×rate(in percentage)×time.

Amount=Interest+Principal.


where Time is give by: number of days/365. This is the enable the interest to increase based on the number of days.


Rate in this context is given by:

6% for 10 - 30 days.

8% for 31 - 60 days.

10% for 61 - 90 days

13% for 91 - 2 years

40% for over 2 years
